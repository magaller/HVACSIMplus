UPDATE to 20.8
Files were copied from working files version 20.6. Version 20.7 has code from Drexel to implement faults, but it is incomplete.
Files from 20.6 were modified by adding new Drexel solver code, with the following changes:
---
**************************************************************
NEW Files:
Blas, Lapack, Nitsol : subroutines for NITSOL solver
nist_solver : Read inputs for NITSOL
user-supplied.f : User specified subroutine for preconditioning. The current implementation use an ideal preconditioning method. Required if the fifth input in nitinput.par is set to 1.
solver.par : Required by subroutine NISTinput, determine which solver to use and the residual tolerance
nitinput.par :  Required by subroutine NISTinput, inputs required by NITSOL solver
**************************************************************
Files Updated:
modeqt.f90 : Add new solver choice for nitsol
modsim.f90 : Add a line of code to call subroutine that read necessary inputs for nitsol
modsim_head.f90 : increase matrix, array sizes to handle more varialbes

Input category was incorrect for several room types. Supply air humidity ratio
was set to category 3 instead of 8 for types 401, 402, 411, and 412. All copies of
typar.dat were updated.
